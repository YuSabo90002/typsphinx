# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-04)

**Core value:** Every CI job passes again on `main` — lint, the full test matrix, coverage, and the docs PDF build — with a dependency set that is pinned and reproducible so this rot doesn't silently recur.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Pin Runtime Dependencies to Known-Good

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Pin Runtime Dependencies to Known-Good)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-04 — ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md traceability created; all 23 v1 requirements mapped across 5 dependency-ordered phases

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Pin runtime deps to known-good rather than port forward to sphinx 9 / typst 0.15 — fastest, lowest-risk path to green CI in a maintenance cycle.
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Pin `typst` to a 0.14.x line compatible with the bundled `@preview` packages — the exact patch must be empirically confirmed during Phase 1 execution, not assumed.
- [Pre-Phase 1]: Modernize Python floor to 3.10–3.13 (drop EOL 3.9, add 3.13) as an atomic batch in Phase 3, sequenced after the pin fix is confirmed green.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: The exact typst 0.14.x patch that satisfies all four bundled `@preview` packages (codly, codly-languages, mitex, gentle-clues) simultaneously is not yet empirically confirmed — this is Phase 1's core deliverable, not a research-time conclusion. If no single 0.14.x version satisfies all four, the documented fallback is pinning one `@preview` package to an older release instead of moving the typst pin.
- [Phase 1]: Whether the `sphinx<9` / `docutils<0.22` ceilings are load-bearing or purely precautionary is unconfirmed — resolve by testing whether `typst<0.15` alone is sufficient, and document the finding regardless (PIN-06).
