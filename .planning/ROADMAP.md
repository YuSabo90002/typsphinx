## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**

- Integer phases (11, 12, 13): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (11.1, 11.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

<summary>✅ v0.4.4 — CI-repair + modernize (Phases 1–5) — SHIPPED 2026-07-05</summary>

Restored a fully green CI pipeline on `main` by pinning the runtime dependency graph back to a
known-good, reproducible combination, then modernized the Python floor (3.10–3.13) and dev tooling
and installed durability guardrails so the drift cannot silently recur. Full phase detail, success
criteria, decisions, and tech-debt notes are preserved in
[`milestones/v0.4.4-ROADMAP.md`](milestones/v0.4.4-ROADMAP.md).

- [x] Phase 1: Pin Runtime Dependencies to Known-Good (2/2 plans) — completed 2026-07-04
- [x] Phase 2: Verify the Green Baseline (3/3 plans) — completed 2026-07-04
- [x] Phase 3: Modernize Python Floor (3.10–3.13) (2/2 plans) — completed 2026-07-04
- [x] Phase 4: Refresh Dev Tooling (4/4 plans) — completed 2026-07-04
- [x] Phase 5: Durability Guardrails (4/4 plans) — completed 2026-07-05

<summary>✅ v0.5.0 — forward-ecosystem (Phases 6–10 + 8.1) — SHIPPED 2026-07-11</summary>

Ported typsphinx forward from the v0.4.4 known-good pins to the current ecosystem — Sphinx 9.1,
docutils 0.22, typst 0.15, Python 3.12–3.13 — bumping the four bundled `@preview` packages in
lockstep to compile cleanly (empirically closing the `unknown variable: kai` break), modernizing the
soft-deprecated docutils/Sphinx API, fixing a long-latent admonition markup/code-mode render bug,
adding a `typst compile` smoke gate, keeping the full 3-OS × Python 3.12–3.13 CI matrix green, and
releasing v0.5.0 to PyPI. Latest-only, no compatibility range. Full phase detail, success criteria,
decisions, and tech-debt notes are preserved in
[`milestones/v0.5.0-ROADMAP.md`](milestones/v0.5.0-ROADMAP.md).

- [x] Phase 6: Raise Runtime Pins + Python Floor (1/1 plan) — completed 2026-07-09
- [x] Phase 7: Bump @preview Packages + typst 0.15 (kai fix) (1/1 plan) — completed 2026-07-11
- [x] Phase 8: API & Test Compatibility (Sphinx 9 / docutils 0.22) (3/3 plans) — completed 2026-07-11
- [x] Phase 8.1: Admonition Rendering Fix (INSERTED) (4/4 plans) — completed 2026-07-11
- [x] Phase 9: Green CI Matrix + Smoke Test + Guardrails (2/2 plans) — completed 2026-07-11
- [x] Phase 10: Version-String Fix + v0.5.0 Release (2/2 plans) — completed 2026-07-11

<summary>✅ v0.6.0 — real-world robustness (Phases 11–15) — SHIPPED 2026-07-13</summary>

Compiled a large real-world documentation set (Sphinx's own `doc/` tree) end-to-end through the
`typstpdf` builder with no fatal Typst errors (GATE-02: ~14.4 MiB PDF, 0 errors), and added correct,
compilable rendering for the most-frequent previously-dropped docutils/Sphinx nodes. Driven by
Issue #114: fixed the two fatal figure/image bugs first (px→pt length conversion + `:target:`/caption
buffer-swap), stood up a standing real-`typst.compile()` acceptance gate (GATE-01) extended by every
node-handler phase, then landed the high-frequency handlers (versionmodified, `refid` cross-refs,
autodoc `desc_*`, footnotes via a doctree pre-pass, transition/topic/line_block/glossary/
tabular_col_spec/abbr) and a graphviz/inheritance_diagram graceful-degrade net. Zero new runtime
dependencies; the 3-way `@preview` version-sync surface untouched. Full phase detail, success
criteria, decisions, and tech-debt notes are preserved in
[`milestones/v0.6.0-ROADMAP.md`](milestones/v0.6.0-ROADMAP.md).

- [x] Phase 11: Issue #114 Fatal Fixes + Graceful-Degrade Net (3/3 plans) — completed 2026-07-12
- [x] Phase 12: High-Volume Independent Node Handlers (4/4 plans) — completed 2026-07-12
- [x] Phase 13: Shared Dispatch-Point Changes (topic + line blocks) (3/3 plans) — completed 2026-07-12
- [x] Phase 14: Footnotes (doctree pre-pass) (2/2 plans) — completed 2026-07-12
- [x] Phase 15: Full-Corpus Validation (3/3 plans) — completed 2026-07-12
